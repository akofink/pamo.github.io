I'm beginning to get more comfortable in traveling alone during my time in India. For the most part, I plan out how to get to and from the destination and let everything else fall into place.
With the help of Uber, some practice in rickshaw haggling, and advice from friends, I've had the courage to trust myself to explore a lot of Pune and ride a train to get to Mumbia.

With each adventure, I later reflect on how potentially stupid these solo adventures could be after I'm home safe.
For example, taking a 9pm return train from Mumbai, arriving well after midnight and hopping into a rickshaw at 1am to get home? Stupid idea.
But I made it home safely and managed to negotiate with the autowallah to let me pay the "local rate" at that time of night.

To add on top of that, most of the day was spent in me walking around some of Mumbai's residential areas to find street art. Each venture into off-beaten paths was met
by locals staring at me with every step and snap I took, wondering what I was up to.

This past weekend was another stretch in putting my trust in the universe. This time I wasn't alone, but we put off purchasing train tickets for a day trip we had been planning the whole week. 
We were met with waitlists on any of the departure times we considered.

So, our only options were to: forget the day trip or put our lives in the hands of random strangers to get to and from Mumbai.
There was no way we were going to let down an opportunity to go explore!

We discovered a service in India called BlaBlaCar and it allows drivers to offer up free seats in their cars for passengers looking to go in the same direction.
The unpredictability of when we'd be getting there and back was not something I really liked, but if someone else was going to take the risk with me and the price was cheaper than hiring a private cab, why not?

The asking price per person to get to Mumbai was reasonable, just a little over the equivalent of $6 USD to travel 150 km (or around 94 mi).
After a few back-and-forth messaging via the app, all we had to do was stand outside a Hyundai dealership at 6:45am with cash to get picked up along the route to Mumbai. No big deal.
