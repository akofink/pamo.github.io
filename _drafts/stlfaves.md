title: Digesting Strange Loop
---
Wow. Wow.

It's been a week since Strange Loop and I'm still in awe of the
great speakers and talks from this year's conference.

### Party!
On top of all the great talks, I also had the opportunity to attend the best conference 
opening party EVER at the [St. Louis City Museum](http://www.citymuseum.org/). 
I'm still scratching my head as to whether or not there were any exhibits I missed 
or if adults running around, crawling through nooks, crannies, tunnels, and attempting 
to slide on ALL slides found in the building was an exhibit itself.

### My Faves

There were many talks that stood out to me and pumped me up about my current work and
the future of the web in general. Some of my other favorites were just fun in general.

Thankfully, Strange Loop has already uploaded all of the talks for future reference on YouTube.


## [The Mess We're In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) _by Joe Armstrong_
was my favorite keynote for the fact that he touched upon being a mindful
developer for those coming after me as well as for my future self. The code we write today should
have great "usability" for those that come along later on to make changes. It should be easy.

### What I Missed

* [Spreadsheets for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CKru5d4GPk) by Felienne Hermans
    * Dude. Spreadsheets are code, turing complete, and not just a programming language -- live programming and fully functional!
