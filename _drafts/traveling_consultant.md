I was sitting in my office last Tuesday in the middle of the Financial District of San Francisco, and, little did I know that, today I would be in Thinking Cup, a coffee shop, on the outskirts of the Leather District in Boston, MA. Welcome to ThoughtWorks! I've fled the nest of staying on a local project to commute to the beast coast for my next project. I've been afraid of taking on this role. That initial shock of fleeing the nest is always hard for me for the first week or so. 

Going to college was no biggie since I had a few friends I could reach out to and I was less than an hour away from home. Travel is exciting! I love to wander new terrains and experience the difference in the thriving masses that inhabit cities. Maybe it's just the jetlag talking, but the change is always jarring until I can find my groove. I find safety and security in finding a routine. The beginning of my ThoughtWorks career taught me that after going from Raleigh, NC, to Chicago, IL, and finally Bangalore, India. Within the first week and a half of my 5 week stay I found my gym, Gold's Gym, surprisingly, and picked up my lifting schedule where I had left off. A week or two after that, I found my favorite grocery store, vegetable stands, and butcher. Yea, eating out is super cheap in India, but I found comfort in making a time and having a mental space where I could cook dinner and think about the events that had occured that day. 

The move to San Francisco was a reverse culture shock. I felt that I was just getting settled into Bangalore by the time it was time to go back "home." The stress was amplified given the knowledge of the difficulty (in 2013) of finding a place to live. That only took a month, and I found my little space of comfort in the Mission. Four Barrel and Dolores Park played a big part in my location choice and any time I return from a trip, I fall in love again.

So here I am in Boston, the city feels lonely given that I'm in a massive hotel that caters to conference attendees, but I am being flexible. Finding the groove and the routine is now turning into a game. There are too many options for favorite X and places to workout and streets to explore.
