I write this post as I'm sitting in front of one of my favorite cafes in San Francisco: Front. One of my methods of exploring London was to pick a cafe that had a reputation for 
good espresso or pour-overs and go! I started noticing that most of these cafes had similar aesthetics or qualities from the outside that made them stand out. 
Most of them had a minimalistic feel and windows you could peer into to get a sense of the magic that was going inside.
So, I started photographing these store fronts, or cafe fronts, to try to capture what I saw as I walked up to another shop. Now as I visit other cities, new cafes
in San Francisco, or revisit old favorites, I try to capture these moments to keep a photo diary of my never-ending caffeine crawl.

With the power of the hash-tag, I've been keeping a log of these shots with #cafefront on Instagram. 
Eventually, my goal is to parse my Instagram feed's JSON to keep a aggregation of shots with the hashtag on a separate page as I add new entries.

For now, here are a few of my shots.
