Coming to South America from South East Asia was quite a culture shock. For one, I went from being mistaken as a local and having to tilt my head
in the difficulty of language barriers when I was spoken to in Hindi, to being spoken to in Spanish and having to answer slowly in Spanglish.

My last meal in India consisted of buffet of paneer and chicken curries accompanied by roti and lots of water to tame the spicy heat.
My first meal in Chile consisted of a avocado, ham, tomato, sandwiched between two massive slices of white bread and topped with yellow cheese and a few sprinkles
of oregano here and there. The proportions of the sandwich were of a laughable size. I had never seen slices of bread so big and I was elated to see so much
avocado on the plate.

I ended up using the knife and fork I was handed to eat the insides of the sandwhich and then eventually nibbled on the soggy bread to enjoy the cheese.
How could a meal be so glaringly bland compared to what I'd been eating the last three months?

I've tried several Chilean "staples" in the few days that I've been here. Caldillo de congrio (a hot fish stew), jardin de mariscos (cold seafood platter), paila marina (mixed seafood stew),
every kind of empanada (salmon, mushroom, beef, plain cheese), a smoked pork leg (pernil), and a couple of more sandwiches and salads.

In every ocassion, I felt like I needed more. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and appetizing (I had missed having access to leafy greens and avocados in India), but where was the flavor? No spice except for when I happened to have my
emergency Sriracha keychain. On several ocassions, huge juicy lemons, what I think was pebre sauce, and bread would arrive at my before the main meal. The pebre sauce had _some_ flavor that accompanied it and tasty on its own. I was eating it like
one would olive oil by dipping the plain pieces of French style bread. More often than not, pebre would be what would flavor my main course if I had any left by the time the plate arrived. If I was lucky, there was black
pepper on the table to add something else.

Despite my longing for more, I am ok with this. Why? The plates were predictable. I had to hack them in a way to adjust to my tastes, but I was the one to make
the call. There were too many times in India where receive something drenched in a mystery sauce that was never mentioned in the description of the item on the menu or
the levels of salt were so much that I needed several more glasses of water to finish the meal.

Maybe my tastebuds just needed a break.
