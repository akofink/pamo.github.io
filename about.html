            <p><span>I'm a busy-body, full-stack application developer living in the <a href="http://www.missionmission.org/" alt="Mission Mission blog" target="_blank">Mission District</a> of San Francisco, CA.</span>
            I identify myself as a lady lifter, coffee geek, and ice cream gourmand with strong hipster tendencies. I prefer vim keybindings over emacs and protein over the other two macronutrients.

            <p>When I'm not <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/pmocampo/" alt="LinkedIn" target="_blank">"writing the codes"</a>, I like to be outside riding my fixed gear bike to a destination, pretending I know how to climb rocks, people-watching, or taking photos of street life.</p>
            <p>I'm driven to learn and get excited when I have the opportunity to teach someone a new skill. </p>
