> I believe humans' age-old association with farm animals provide important intangible benefits to humanity. We are better for living alongside them. Those of us who have the pleasure of being around them every day likely benefit the most. We are taught in stark relief the lessons of nature -- the inevitability of illness, injury, and death; the cycles of birth, growth, aging, and decline. We are constantly reminded of the fragility of life, of what it takes to be a good parent, of bravery, patience, loyalty. If we are paying attention, we are learning from them, constantly.

Nicolette Hahn Niman, _Defending Beef: The Case for Sustainable Meat Production_

![Double Trouble](double_trouble.jpg)

The last time I visited my grandparents was over 17 years ago. Each visit to Mexico brought about lasting experiences around farm animals. It's been years since they've passed away and reading Niman's words about living with animals reminded me of what it was like to walk the farm my grandparents owned in Guerrero. My visit to Goatlandia brought back memories of helping herd a small piglet that had escaped and had been nibbling on the corn  my grandpa had just sowed. The agile piglet couldn't be cornered and my only other tactic at the time was to lunge my 10 year old self and stop it with a bear hug. ðŸ˜…

I didn't lunge at any goats this time but there were plenty of goat hugs to go around.
