It's not every day I take cooking classes on a whim, and definitely not when [the cost](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cooking-classes-with-cocco-nomura-tickets-28903389817#) is more than what I would ever pay for a dinner, but cooking with Cocco at Izakaya Rintaro felt very special and I'm happy to have taken part.

[Izakaya Rintaro](http://4sq.com/1ojnS0R) is a Japanese restaurant that's tucked into an unassuming compound behind [Rainbow Grocery](http://www.rainbow.coop/). I've always ridden by on my bike and wondered what it was like inside.

The reveal after I walked in to join the class was surprising.

Everything about Rintatro felt delicate and tranquil. Any noise that may have been going on outside completely melted away and I was drawn into the natural lighting that loomed over the kitchen and restaurant.

The class was 4 hours long and concluded with lunch. What lured me in was the opportunity to learn from Japanese Chef and author [Cocco Nomura](). She recently won first place in the [Family](http://www.cookbookfair.com/index.php/gourmand-awards/winners-2016/cookbooks-and-food-culture-shortlist-2016) category of the [Gourmand World Cookbook Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourmand_World_Cookbook_Awards) with her book _Japan - Pass the recipe_ that walks through the months of the year and celebrates the seasonal dishes of each month.

In addition, the [#FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) factor was high on this one because the class was the last of four she would be leading during her short visit to San Francisco.

Before we began, Cocco and her assistant explained some rules she likes to follow when cooking.

>Always respect the ingredients and use them completely.

This means leave no stem or seed unused.

>Always give your full energy to the moment and appreciate how your guest will enjoy it.

With this statement I was invested to take as many notes as possible.

## Theme of Five
In addition, the theme of _five_ would be present in each recipe in the sense of
* **5 tastes**: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami.
* **5 colors**: red, yellow, green, black, white.
* **5 styles of prepping**: steaming, grilling, simmering, raw, and fried.

## Technique
In a few of the recipes, we'd focus on learning a specific technique, such as:
* **how to cut** effectively when pickling root vegetables

~[Cutting vegetables so that they have the maximum surface area for pickling.](japanese-pickling.jpg)

* **how to marinate** when preparing [shio koji](http://www.justonecookbook.com/how_to/how-to-make-shio-koji/) for marinating shrimp.
* **how to fold** spring roll wraps in a way to keep the contents inside for frying

* **how to to wrap** potato cake and magnolia leaves with fillings

* and how to use a variety of Japanese tools to press rice into festive shapes.

Cocco had some other tricks up her sleeves such as how to press meat into a perfect ball with her fists.
