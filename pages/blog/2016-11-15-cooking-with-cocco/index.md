It's not every day I take cooking classes on a whim and definitely not when the cost is more than what I would ever pay for a dinner, but this felt very special and I'm happy to have taken part.
Izakaya Rintaro is a Japanese restaurant that's tucked into what seems like a compound behind Rainbow Grocery. I've always ridden by on my bike and wondered what it was like inside.

The reveal after I walked in to join the class was surprising. Everything about it felt delicate and tranquil. Any noise that may have been going on outside completely melted away and I was drawn into the natural lighting that loomed over the kitchen and restaurant.

The class was 4 hours long and concluded with lunch. What lured me in was the opportunity to learn from Japanese Chef and author [Cocco Nomura](). She recently won first place in the [Family]() category of the [Gourmand Cooking *blah*]() with her book [*blah*]() that walks through the months of the year and celebrates the seasonal dishes of each month.

The class I signed up for was also the last of four she would be leading during her short visit to San Francisco.
