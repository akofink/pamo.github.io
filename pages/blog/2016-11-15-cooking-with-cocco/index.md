It's not every day I take cooking classes on a whim, and definitely not when [the cost](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cooking-classes-with-cocco-nomura-tickets-28903389817#) is more than what I would ever pay for a dinner, but cooking with Cocco at Izakaya Rintaro felt very special and I'm happy to have taken part.

[Izakaya Rintaro](http://4sq.com/1ojnS0R) is a Japanese restaurant that's tucked into an unassuming compound behind [Rainbow Grocery](http://www.rainbow.coop/). I've always ridden by on my bike and wondered what it was like inside.

The reveal after I walked in to join the class was surprising. Everything about it felt delicate and tranquil. Any noise that may have been going on outside completely melted away and I was drawn into the natural lighting that loomed over the kitchen and restaurant.

The class was 4 hours long and concluded with lunch. What lured me in was the opportunity to learn from Japanese Chef and author [Cocco Nomura](). She recently won first place in the [Family](http://www.cookbookfair.com/index.php/gourmand-awards/winners-2016/cookbooks-and-food-culture-shortlist-2016) category of the [Gourmand World Cookbook Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourmand_World_Cookbook_Awards) with her book _Japan - Pass the recipe_ that walks through the months of the year and celebrates the seasonal dishes of each month.

The class I signed up for was also the last of four she would be leading during her short visit to San Francisco.
