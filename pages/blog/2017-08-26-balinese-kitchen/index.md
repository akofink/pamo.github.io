When it comes to traveling, experiencing a new culture through its food is a given. However, during my search for experiences to have in Bali, a cooking class teaching traditional cuisine made its way into my plans.

## Balinese Culture
It’s customary to go through different ceremonies in life to achieve adulthood. The ones mentioned during our tour and cooking glass we primarily focused on Balinese men. Marriage is an experience in which families join to come to agreement.  Apparently, having teeth filed as a coming of age opportunity was one that made my hair rise.
Family compounds are forever. You will never see a family compound up for sale. Families stick together and there’s no such thing as ‘flying the nest’. A male’s residence in the compound changes position in the course of his maturity. The close-knit families make it very rare to see homeless in Bali.
The Bali kite festival is a rooted tradition that has many representations that have changed over time. In a few ways, it represents freedom and coming of age or a symbol of maturity. Bali’s youth took to the rice fields during dusk to get kite flying practice in for the day.
Men stay in the kitchen. Women make the offerings. This is partly because offerings symbolize beauty. There was a brief mention that you will not see men making offerings in Bali, and if you do, that man is referred to a “beautiful man”.

## Payangan Morning Market
Just a short drive away from Ubud is the region of Payangan. We went here to experience a true open-air market experience without the tourism that lies inside of Ubud's similar market. Our 9am arrival was during the market's lull given that it normally starts at 2 am and over by 10 am. As the saying goes, the early bird gets the worm.

Our tour of the market was simply educational. We browsed each stand and Sang Made, our market guide, pointed out a few ingredients we’d be using in the dishes we would cook at the Lobong family compound.
One of the more memorable moments was at the beginning of our tour when we looked over at a stand with a full suckling pig laid out ready for consumption. According to our guide, suckling pig is Bali's breakfast of champions. The group was stunned. Fruit bowls and eggs seemed to be what was being served in the hotels, but Sang Made clarified that yes, that is what is served to foreigners — not what is actually consumed in a Balinese home.
